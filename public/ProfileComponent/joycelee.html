            <p style="font-size: 15px; width: 1200px; height: 450px;">Hi, my name is Joyce Lee. I am currently a Senior at the University at Buffalo majoring in Computer Science. 
                I am on the road to obtainiing my Bachelor degree. Throughout my time in college I have been creating lots of memories with my friends and have learned a lot through my studies. 
                My junior year I joined a Co-Ed Professional fraternity called Theta Tau. 
                Throughout my time affilated with the fraternity, I was head of the diversity committee that helps spread awareness on different cultures.
                Last semester I was also Assistant Pledge Educator, in this position I helped delegate task among the potential new members and guide them to the brotherhood. 
                Besides being in a professional fraternity, I also play video games with my friends from time to time- League of Legends.
                This online game is one of the games that has helped me relax after a busy day or helped relieved my stress. 
                I would say college has helped shaped me into the person I am today. Through numerous all-nighters, hangouts, and memories, I would most definitely miss my time in college.
                After I graduate I am going to be a full time employee in Texas. Thank you for your time. Have a wonderful day.
