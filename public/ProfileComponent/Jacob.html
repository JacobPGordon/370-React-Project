    <p>Hi, I'm Jacob Gordon! I'm a senior at UB and I'm currently studying for a degree in computer science. After school I'm hoping to get into the computing
        field, either as a software developer or just a data entry/management specialist; anything computer related would do for me! Most of my experience lies 
        in java, but I also know some C+ and HTML. I'm a huge gamer, and I also enjoy reading. I also really like to listen to music and just walk around; it 
        gets my creative juices flowing and feels great.
