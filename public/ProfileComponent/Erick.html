            <p> Hi, my name is Erick Slager. I am currently a senior student at the University at Buffalo, studying computer science. Areas I'm
                passionate about include web development, machine learning & artificial intellegence, and cyber security. After I graduate with my B.A. in Computer Science 
                I hope to get admitted into graduate studies here at UB to learn more. My favorite language to work (contradictory to my areas of passion) is C++. I am also a
                member of the MakeOpenSource and the ACM club here on campus My hobbies outside of the tech world and outside of school involve Volleyball, 
                Tennis, Cooking, Music, Photography, and Travelling!
