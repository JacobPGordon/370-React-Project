            <p>Hi, my name is Joyce He. I am a third year student attending UB for my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
                    I have a very strong interest in software development and would like to improve on my skills in that area.
                    I have been intested in this field and computer science since my freshman year of high school. I have experiences in 
                    many languages, but my strong suit would be Python, HTML, and Java. During my free time, I like to play pok√©mon games 
                    with my friends and cook with my roommates. I also enjoy watch animes. After I graduate, I would like to get a job doing 
                    software development, specifically, front end.
            </p>
