                watching TV shows and movies, huge comic book fan (read a lot of DC and Marvel comics while growing up), I love to learn a lot and I love to go out, explore places around. I currently work with CodePath, an organization who's mission is 
                to enpower students who come from a minority background and who are also majoring in Computer Science to teach them iOS, Andriod Development or Cybersecurity. I work as a Tech Fellow where I teach those students the skills they need 
                to be successful in the tech industry. I play video games sometimes with my friends, I played League of Legends and Minecraft. I will work as an intern full-time in this upcoming summer of 2022 where I will be working as a software
                engineer in New Jersey and I am excited to be working over the summer at Accenture.
